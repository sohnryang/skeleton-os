# skeletonOS

OS with bare bones only. (That's why the name is skeletonOS)

## Why?

I cloned [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) a few weeks ago, and still don't know what I should do. So I decided to learn some OS concepts by building one.

## Project Goals

- Write most of the OS in C language for portability
  - Main target arch will be x86(-64) and ARM though
- Should run on actual hardware such as Raspberry Pi
- Feature basic OS elements like file system, such as file system and process scheduling.
